        What you just saw in this scenario was a case of hypoglycemia! The further you progressed into the game, the more severe the case became!

        Hypoglycemia is a condition in which your blood sugar (glucose) level is lower than the standard range, and it can happen for a large number of reasons. 

        Some causes can include skipping meals, increased exercise levels, and drinking alcohol.

        Some of the symptoms include shakiness, headaches, blurred vision, confusion, nervousness, and many more.

        At a non-professional level, some of the best treatment for someone that is suffering from hypoglycemia, especially a diabetic, is to give them something that is high in sugar content. This could be candy, soda, juice.
        Especially things high in natural sugars such a raisins or other fruits.

        Once the person loses consciousness or there appear to be other abnormal or worrying symptoms, please call a professional or take them to the hospital.
